            <h1>Joshua Tint</h1>
            <p>I am a software engineer and computational linguistics researcher, currently at Amazon. I work on understanding how language models work in a social context, including pragmatics and fairness research.</p>
            <p> Our language shapes and is shaped by our social connections. Language models have achieved exceptional results, but one of the most difficult frontiers is breaching this social dimension to language. Models that can communicate in social text as well as humans can will be more aware, more intelligent, and more fair. I do work towards realizing that goal.  </p>
            <p> Previously, I was a graduate student at Arizona State University at the <a href="https://ransml.github.io/lens-lab/">LENS Lab</a>. My advisors were Ransalu Senanayake and Chitta Baral.</p>
